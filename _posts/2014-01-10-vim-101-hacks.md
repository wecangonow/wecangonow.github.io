#Chapter 2:Basic Navigation

There are three chapters dedicated to Navigation - Basic,Advanced and Expert Navigation.

If you only use the h,j,k,l chapters to navigate,you will soon realize this is very painful and time-consuming.

Hacks in the navigation chapters will help you navigate file content very effectively with less key strokes.


##Hack 1.Scroll Full Page or Half Page


On a large file,using h,j,k,l and keys to scroll down pages is not effective.

Use the following page navigation keys.

| Navigation Key | Description           |
| CTRL-F         | Scroll down full page |
| CTRL-B         | Scroll up full page   |
| CTRL-D         | Scroll down half page |
| CTRL-U         | Scroll up half page   |


Instead of using j and k, you can also use CTRL keys to scroll one line at a time as explained below.

There is a slight visual difference between using j,k keys and this CTRL keys.Try it out yourself to see the difference.


| Navigation Key | Description           |
| CTRL-E         | Scroll down full page |
| CTRL-Y         | Scroll up full page   |


##Hack 2.Word Navigation 

Using h and l and navigate horizontally is very painful and time-consuming.

You can navigate words effectively using the word navigation keys mentioned below.


| Navigation Key | Description                          |
| w              | Go to the beginning of the next word |
| W              | Go to the beginning of next WORD     |
| e              | Go to the end of current word        |
| E              | Go to the end of current WORD        |
| b              | Go to the beginning of previous word |
| B              | Go to the beginning of previous WORD |


word VS WORD

word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores. WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters,separated with white space.

   * For example,192.168.1.3 contains seven words.But the whole 192.168.1.3 is considered as one WORD.
