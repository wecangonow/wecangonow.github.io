#Building Blocks

In this section, we review the primary low-level constructs that we use to stroe and process information in java. All
the data that we process on a computer ultimately decompose into individual bits, but writing programs that exclusively process bits would be tiresome indeed. Types allow us to specify how will use particular sets of bits,and methods allow us to specify the operations that we will perform on the data.

We use java classes to describe the information thae we process, to define the methods and processing them, and to make objects that actually hold the information. All of our data structures are comprised of objects and references to objects. In this section, we consider these basic java mechanisms, in the context of presenting a general approach to organizing our programs. Our primary goal is to lay the groundwork for the development.
